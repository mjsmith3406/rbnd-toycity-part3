I spent more time on this that the other projects. It was a a little
difficult to get my head around objects and having multiple classes.
I feel better now over coming the problems I had and getting the right
output.

1) find_by_customer, is the first thing I thought of to add. I think it
would be nice if a person needed to find the customer weather to see
if they exist and maybe could be expanded to see all the purchases they
made.
2) sort_by_stock, is the second thing I added. I thought it would be
nice to know what is in stock. This way you can see which item has
the most stock down to what is out of stock.

I still have room to grow in understanding how objects work and how
exactly I can access them when ever I need them. I had a lot of
trouble with this project, but I came out of it with a little better
understanding of how OOP works.
